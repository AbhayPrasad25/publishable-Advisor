3 Methodology
ToinvestigatetherelationshipbetweenAugmentedReality(AR)andsynchronizedFlamencodance,
weemployedamultidisciplinaryapproach,combiningtechniquesfromcomputerscience,psychology,
anddancetheory. Ourmethodologyconsistedofseveralstages,includingdatacollection,participant
recruitment,andthedevelopmentofabespokeLSTM-basedgestureforecastingsystem. Webegan
by recruiting a cohort of 50 experienced Flamenco dancers, who were tasked with performing
4a series of coordinated dance rituals while wearing AR-enabled wristbands. These wristbands,
whichwedesignedandfabricatedin-house,utilizedacombinationofaccelerometer,gyroscope,and

TheARcomponentofoursystemwasimplementedusingacustom-builtapplication,whichutilized

allowed us to achieve significantly improved accuracy in our gesture forecasting model, and we

Another unexpected finding that emerged from our research was the discovery that the dancers’
movements were often influenced by a range of subconscious factors, including their emotional
state, their level of fatigue, and even their personal relationships with their fellow dancers. To
investigatethisphenomenon,wedevelopedanovel"emotionalcontagion"framework,whichutilized

We also explored the use of unconventional machine learning architectures, such as a bespoke

phases: thefirstphasefocusedonindividualskilldevelopment,whereeachparticipantlearnedthe
fundamental steps and rhythms of flamenco. The second phase concentrated on group cohesion,
whereparticipantspracticeddancingtogether,emphasizingsynchronizationandcoordination.
Uponcompletingthetrainingprogram,theparticipantsweredividedintoseveralgroups,eachwitha

Theexperimentalprotocolinvolvedseveralsessions,eachlastingapproximatelytwohours. During
these sessions, the dancers performed a variety of flamenco routines, with and without the AR

Our investigation into the intersection of Augmented Reality (AR) and synchronized flamenco

a plethora of intriguing results. Initially, we observed that the integration of AR elements into
